Positives I took out of this project

First project experience on Node.js, full stack experience on javascript
First experience on Express framework with ORM sequelize.
Learnt and used the data passport for authentication, some experiment on passport google oauth. 
More experience on bootstrap framework, which makes it much more comfortable now.


Struggles, and things to work on going forward

* Again, having a clear scope and how to go about it. is importan to every project. Scope is changing because the difficulty of learning new framework stumbled me a few times.
* The lack of docs, tutorial and less maturity of Node made me struggle with different version of syntax.
* Its painful to work with sequelize especially the relational model, even not too much solution you can google. So quetions asked on forums can only be answered by myself....
* Definite try the mean stack for the next project, moongo db seems to be lighter and flexible.
* Got some improvement, though still frustrated by a lack of visual design talent.
